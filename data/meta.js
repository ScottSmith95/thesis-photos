      <p>
        I'm Scott Smith, digital creative in Seattle Washington. 
        I take lots of photos and spend most of my week building products 
        for impact-focused companies.
      </p>
      <p>
        My photos focus on portraiture including fashion and dance 
        as well as engagement photography.
